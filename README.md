## Hey, I'm `@lunatic-coded`.

I make the most hacked together code known to man. Who needs *efficiency* when it just **WORKS**. <br>
- I know a decent bit with coding python (slow yet easy) 🐍 <br>
- I make horrible games worse than mobile games cause everything else gets restricted. <br>
<br>
Yeah that's about it, maybe I'll create something good eventually like how infinite monkeys will eventually write Hamlet.
